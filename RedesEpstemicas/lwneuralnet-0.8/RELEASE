Lightweight Neural Network (lwneuralnet), Version 0.8

This is a lightweight implementation of a neural network in C.  It
provides a multilayer perceptron network with backpropagation training.
It is small, fast, easy to embed in an application and easy to extend.

Lwneuralnet doesn't do anything fancy: no millions of different types of
neural networks, no graphical user interface, just the routines for 
computing and training a backpropagation neural network. It is 
primarily intended for use in applications that just happen to need a 
simple neural network and have no use for complicated neural network 
libraries.

Included with lwneuralnet is an example application that trains a neural
network to recognize handwritten digits.

New in this release is support for bias terms.
