version 0.8 -- 28 July 2005
  * Bias terms.

version 0.7 -- 26 October 2003
  * Batch training by Lorenzo Masetti.
  * Cleaner OCR example application.

version 0.6 -- 9 October 2003
  * Restored factor 0.5 in output error.
  * Error handling for file I/O.
  * Possible to use in C++ now.
  * Included example ocr application.
  * Included binary file I/O routines by Lorenzo Masetti.

version 0.5 -- 26 September 2003
  * Changed return type of some functions from network_t * to void.
  * Changed name of header file to lwneuralnet.h and of library to
    liblwneuralnet.a.
  * Some changes to make the API more consistent.
  * More documentation.

version 0.4 -- 11 September 2003
  * Faster approximation for sigma.
  * Fixed net_copy, net_add_neurons, and net_remove_neurons.
  * Uniformized access operations.
  * net_reset_deltas in interface.
  * Tests.
	
version 0.3 -- 31 August 2003
  * Fixed and updated example code.
  * Removed settable gain from the code: setting gain to a certain
    value is the same as multiplying all weights by this value, so 
    training should take care of this.
  * Removed compile time option to not apply sigma in the output
    layer.
  * Removed target parameter from net_train, which was obsoleted by
    requiring net_compute_output_error to be called before net_train.
 
version 0.2 -- 28 August 2003
  * Moved to SourceForge <http://sourceforge.net/project/lwneuralnet/>.
  * Documentation added.
  * net_train now requires net_compute_output_error to be called first.

version 0.1 -- 9 July 2000
  * First release.
